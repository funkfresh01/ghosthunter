Pytor
-----
A very simple http connect back shell that connects to a Tor hidden service.

It uses a http proxy to connect to the Tor network without implementing the full protocol.


Setup
-----

The python scripts are located in the src subdirectory.

* Server: 
The user must install Tor in a computer and setup a hidden service as described in the Tor manual.

http://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en

Pytor will listen in 127.0.0.1:8080 for connections.


Note: You must change the variable called passwd and put your own.

* Client:
Change:
- The variable called hidden_service for the hidden service you installed in your computer.
- The variable called passwd and put your own.


Usage
-----
The server runs without parameters and it will prompt for commands as soon as a client connects.
The client connects just one time in case it is called without parameters, but this behavior
can be changed with the -c flag.

Use the command "quit" to finish the client execution


Freezing Pytor
--------------
Execute 'make' in the main directory and the code will be compiled and the binaries copied  to
the bin directory.


Gotcha
------
The client may experience problems connecting to the server in case your Tor tunnel is too slow because
the proxy server has a low time out.
